        <p class="blog-intro">
          What happens when we outsource our thinking to AI?<br />
          A recent MIT study holds a sobering mirror to our cognitive habits.
        </p>

        <h2>The Brain Scans Don’t Lie</h2>
        <p>
          Researchers strapped EEG electrodes to 54 college students and observed three groups:
          writing essays with no digital help, with Google search, and with ChatGPT-4o. The results
          were startling.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-highlight">
          The ChatGPT group showed the weakest, most fragmented neural connectivity of all.
        </p>

        <h2>The Memory Problem</h2>
        <p>
          After writing, participants were asked to recall their own words. 83% of ChatGPT users
          couldn’t remember content from minutes earlier, compared to just 11% in the other two
          groups.
        </p>
        <p>When you outsource thinking, your brain stops forming memories of the work.</p>

        <h2>The Dependency Trap</h2>
        <p>
          Strikingly, even when ChatGPT was removed, the AI-dependent group struggled to re-engage
          their cognitive networks, while those who began with brain-only writing used AI later as
          an enhancement rather than a crutch.
        </p>

        <h2>Practical Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
          Efficiency is seductive, but without deliberate engagement, we risk atrophying our mental
          muscles. Productivity tools should augment, not replace, our thinking.
        </p>

        <h2>The Three-Pass System</h2>
        <p>I follow a three-pass approach:</p>
        <ul class="blog-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Pass 1: Brain Only (15 minutes)</strong> – Sketch ideas and draft without any AI
            or research.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pass 2: Research & AI Assistance (30 minutes)</strong> – Bring in external help
            to inform and challenge your initial thoughts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pass 3: Synthesis & Ownership (20 minutes)</strong> – Close all tools and craft
            the final version from your own understanding.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Weekly Cognitive Workout</h2>
        <p>
          Dedicate regular sessions to paper-based problem solving, memory recall, and discussion
          without digital aids. The goal isn’t perfect output—it’s strengthening the neural pathways
          that make you uniquely human.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          AI can be a powerful ally, but true mastery demands cognitive ownership. Tools execute
          tasks at machine speed; your vision, insight, and curiosity remain your greatest assets.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-highlight">Don’t let AI make you ordinary. Let it make you unstoppable.</p>
