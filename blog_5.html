          The secret to 10-minute delivery isn't driver speed.<br />
          The average delivery distance is shorter than your morning walk.<br />
          Dark stores are everywhere, hiding in plain sight.
        </p>

        <p>
          I mapped quick-commerce infra in Indian cities. Every dark store, real routing data, 
          actual coverage zones across major urban hubs, across Blinkit, Zepto, and Instamart.

        <h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
        <p>
          Quick-commerce companies like Blinkit, Zepto, and Instamart promise 10-minute deliveries. 
          But how much of a city can they actually reach in that time? This map answers that 
          question by showing the true delivery footprint of every dark store.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 1: Finding All the Dark Stores</h2>
        <p>
          We needed the locations of every dark store across major Indian cities. A community member 
          on Reddit (u/sigmaAs) had already mapped these stores using Google Maps. We exported 
          that data as a geographic file (KML format) containing the exact coordinates of each 
          store, organized by brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Result:</strong> A dataset of all known Blinkit, Zepto, and Instamart dark store 
          locations across Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Pune.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 2: Generating Coverage Zones (Isochrones)</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of drawing simple circles around each store (which would be inaccurate), we used 
          <strong>isochrones</strong>. These are shapes that represent all the areas reachable 
          from a point within a specific time, accounting for actual roads, one-ways, and 
          traffic patterns.
        </p>
        
        <p>We used two different calculation methods:</p>
        
        <ul class="blog-list">
          <li>
            <strong>For Walking (Customer Accessibility):</strong> Based on average human walking 
            speed of 5 km/hr. Shows what areas a customer can walk to the store from in 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For Delivery (Rider Coverage):</strong> Based on area-specific average speeds 
            for delivery riders. Different neighborhoods have different speeds based on road 
            conditions and traffic density.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          For example: Koramangala averages 15 km/hr, Whitefield averages 22 km/hr, while HSR Layout 
          averages 17 km/hr. These speeds were calibrated for each locality across all five cities 
          using Geoapify's Isolines API.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 3: Pre-Computing Everything</h2>
        <p>
          Real-time API calls for hundreds of stores would be slow and expensive. So we 
          pre-computed all the isochrone data: Every city × Every store × Both modes (walk + delivery).
        </p>
        <p>
          This resulted in high-fidelity polygon data stored as JSON files. When you open the app, 
          it loads instantly because everything is already calculated.
        </p>
        
        <p>Data sizes give you an idea of coverage density:</p>
        <ul class="blog-list">
          <li>Bangalore delivery mode: ~54 MB of polygon data</li>
          <li>Delhi delivery mode: ~49 MB of polygon data</li>
          <li>Pune and Hyderabad: ~11-12 MB each</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 4: Adding Orientation Layers</h2>
        <p>
          A coverage map is only useful if you can orient yourself. We added:
        </p>
        <ul class="blog-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Metro Lines:</strong> Extracted from Overpass Turbo (OpenStreetMap). Queried 
            for all metro/rail lines with their official colors, exported as GeoJSON, and overlaid 
            on the map.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Geographic Features:</strong> Lakes, parks, and major landmarks are visible 
            on the base map with city labels and neighborhood names for quick reference.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step 5: The Visualization</h2>
        <p>
          Everything comes together on an interactive Leaflet map:
        </p>
        <ul class="blog-list">
          <li><strong>Heatmap Mode:</strong> Overlapping coverage areas blend together, showing coverage density.</li>
          <li><strong>Polygon Mode:</strong> Individual store coverage zones are visible with clear boundaries.</li>
          <li><strong>Brand Filtering:</strong> Toggle between Blinkit (yellow), Zepto (purple), and Instamart (orange).</li>
          <li><strong>Quick Navigation:</strong> Jump to specific neighborhoods using area pills.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <ul class="blog-list">
          <li><strong>Coverage Gaps:</strong> Instantly see which areas are underserved.</li>
          <li><strong>Brand Comparison:</strong> Compare which platform has better coverage in your neighborhood.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility Analysis:</strong> Click anywhere to test if that location is within 10-minute reach.</li>
        </ul>
